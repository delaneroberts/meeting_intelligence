# Meeting Intelligence Mobile (Expo)

This is a minimal React Native (Expo) scaffold with the **Meeting Name** modal screen.

## What’s included
- `App.js` renders `MeetingNameScreen`.
- `src/screens/MeetingNameScreen.js` contains the small modal input.

## Run locally

```zsh
cd /Users/delaneroberts/meeting_intelligence/mobile_app
npm install
npm run start
```

Then open the Expo app on your device or start an iOS/Android simulator.
